Hello welcome to the read me



Project team : Kelly St.Onge (Just me)


The app: is supposed to launch a menu screen which will allow someone to play a 2d platformer game

using a left and right arrows and jump on enemies , and collect coins while acting like a platformer.

if you are hit or fall off the edge the game goes to a game over scree where you can try again or go to main



to run:


under gamefiles folder

open 2d_platformer.xcodeproj

this should open xcode

In the project file viewer on the left side of xcode click on the blue icon that says 2d_platformer

in the signing and capabilities tab to the right, you should see a red error,  add your team name to the debug and release.

in the build settings tab make sure to turn on standard architectures so that you can run any ios device the simulator


I ran the simulator on iphone 13 pro max ios 15.4


there will still be an error , click on it and in the drop down double click on 2d platformer this will prompt a diolouge, tell it to perform the changes


build and run on a simulator of choice


the game is best played on a mobile device physical mobile device


collect 10 coins and win, watch out for enemies. 


Thanks have a good summer!
